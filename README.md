# SV2 Apps Repository

This repository contains the application-level crates, currently in **alpha** stage.
If you're looking for the low-level protocol libraries, check out the [`stratum` repository](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum). Those crates provide the foundational protocol implementations used as dependencies by these applications.

## Contents

- `pool-apps/` - Pool operator applications
  - `pool/` - SV2-compatible mining pool server that communicates with downstream roles and Template Providers
  - `jd-server/` - Job Declarator Server coordinates job declaration between miners and pools, maintains synchronized mempool
- `miner-apps/` - Miner applications
  - `jd-client/` - Job Declarator Client allows miners to declare custom block templates for decentralized mining
  - `translator/` - Translator Proxy bridges SV1 miners to SV2 pools, enabling protocol transition
  - `mining-device/` - Mining device simulator for development and testing
- `stratum-apps/` - Shared application utilities
  - Configuration helpers (TOML, coinbase outputs, logging)
  - Network connection utilities (Noise protocol, plain TCP, SV1 connections)
  - RPC client implementation
  - Key management utilities
  - Custom synchronization primitives
- `integration-tests/` - End-to-end integration tests validating interoperability between all components


## ‚õèÔ∏è Getting Started

To get started with the Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI), please follow the detailed setup instructions available on the official website:

[Getting Started with Stratum V2](https://stratumprotocol.org/blog/getting-started/)

This guide provides all the necessary information on prerequisites, installation, and configuration to help you begin using, testing or contributing to SRI.

## üõ£ Roadmap 

Our roadmap is publicly available, outlining current and future plans. Decisions on the roadmap are made through a consensus-driven approach, through participation on dev meetings, Discord or GitHub.

[View the SRI Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/stratum-mining/projects/15)

## üíª Contribute
